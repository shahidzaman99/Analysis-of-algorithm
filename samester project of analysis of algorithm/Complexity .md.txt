CS Drone Delivery – Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity
O(N × I)

N = number of nests (candidate solutions)

I = number of iterations

Each cuckoo performs a Lévy flight and a comparison per iteration, both in constant time.

Space Complexity
O(N)

Each cuckoo (nest) stores only its position (x, y) and fitness value.

Notes
Suitable for small to medium grid-based optimization problems.

Can be extended with adaptive step sizes, multiple delivery points, or dynamic constraints.

Lévy flight introduces random long-range jumps, improving exploration in large spaces.
