✅ Step-by-Step Pseudocode for Cuckoo Search
Define the target delivery location (e.g., (7, 5)).

Initialize a population of nests (cuckoo solutions) with random positions on a 2D grid.

For each nest, calculate the fitness (Euclidean distance to the target).

Repeat for a number of iterations:

For each cuckoo:

Generate a new solution using Lévy flight (a random long jump in space).

Calculate the fitness of the new solution.

Randomly select an existing nest.

If the new solution has better fitness, replace the selected nest.

Abandon a fraction pa of the worst nests and generate new random positions.

Print the final positions and fitness (distance to the target) of all nests.
